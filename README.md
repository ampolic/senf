# Senf
Senf is a python based headless, flat-file content management graphical user interface. This project is very much in its early stages but the goal is to have python3 -m senf create a web server which hosts a CMS based on locally stored JSON files descibing the types of data needed. Users would then input the data via their browser and senf would save the data locally in JSON files. While it can be used for other things, senf is intended to be used as a CMS for blockable (replacing netflify)

### NOTE: Senf is still in it's early development and may not function or be feature-complete.
